# Streams

A lightweight F#/C# library for efficient functional-style pipelines on streams of data.

The main design behind Streams is inspired by Java 8 Streams and is based on the observation that many functional pipelines follow the pattern:

    source/generator |> lazy |> lazy |> lazy |> eager/reduce

* Source/generator are functions that create Streams like Stream.ofArray/Stream.init.
* Lazy functions take in streams and return streams like Stream.map/Stream.filter, these operations are fused together for efficient iteration.
* Eager/reduce are functions like Stream.iter/Stream.sum that force the Stream to evaluate up to that point.

The main difference between LINQ/Seq and Streams is that LINQ is about composing external iterators (Enumerable/Enumerator) and  Streams is based on the continuation-passing-style composition of internal iterators.

For simple pipelines we have observed performance improvements of a factor of four and for more complex pipelines the performance gains are even greater.
Important performance tip: Make sure that FSI is running with 64-bit option set to true and fsproj option prefer 32-bit is unchecked.
